## Core Capabilities

### High Availability Clustering
Native implementation of the Node.js Cluster module allows for seamless multi-core process management. This ensures maximum CPU utilization, automatic worker recovery, and zero-downtime service availability under high traffic loads.

### Premium Documentation Engine
A highly customized Scalar integration featuring a glassmorphism design system. Includes a theme-aware preloader and hardware-accelerated transitions that automatically adapt to system-level light and dark mode preferences.

### Security and Rate Management
Robust security layer providing mandatory header validation, CORS policy enforcement, and a tiered rate-limiting system. Supports high-throughput access via secure API Key authentication.
